            <h3>MY EXPERIENCE</h3>
            As web development is all about designing, it needs extra creativity to make a websites. Designing something is not so easy. It takes time and creativity to create a new design. As being in learning phase, this module taught me to be creative and learn new, creative and interesting stuffs. I learned that the combination of HTML and CSS properties makes a website. I learned to mix those effectively and properly in different text editors like Notepad++, Sublime Text Editor.  I got to experience new design trends of both HTML and CSS. This module also helped me to develop different designs of website. I got to learn about the Google Material Design, FlexBox, Github and Responsive designs with media queries that I was unaware of. Now, I can easily add my projects to github. I was able to push and pull the repository out of github while doing my projects. I could write codes in organized way. Learning these thing was not easy but was worth it. It helped me to begin the first step to become a web developer.
